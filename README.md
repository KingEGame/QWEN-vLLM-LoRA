# Qwen3-4B + vLLM + LoRA

Serve Qwen3-4B via vLLM, then customize it for customer support with a LoRA
adapter trained on your own docs.

Authored to run on **Linux or WSL2** with an NVIDIA GPU. Native Windows cannot
run the GPU stack; Windows teammates use the thin setup wrappers below, which
forward into WSL.

## Onboarding (setup only)

One command installs the Python venv, dependencies, and verifies CUDA/vLLM.
Starting the server and sending a test request are **manual** next steps.

**Windows (PowerShell or cmd):**

```bat
scripts\setup.cmd
```

or:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup.ps1
```

**Linux / already inside WSL:**

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

When setup finishes, activate the venv it created, then:

```bash
./scripts/start_server.sh
# in another terminal, with the venv active:
python scripts/test_client.py
```

## Troubleshooting

Driver, CUDA, and out-of-memory issues are documented in:

- [Design: Qwen + vLLM + LoRA setup](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-qwen-vllm-lora-setup-design.md)
- [Design: easy onboard setup scripts](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-easy-onboard-setup-scripts-design.md)

Tune model/port/context in `config/model.env` — setup does not rewrite it.

## Unit tests (no GPU required)

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```
